    <h1>Lesson Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      In this lesson I learned how to better navigate github. Using the
      techniques I learned in this lesson, along with what I remembered from my
      previous attempt, I was able to recover some files I believed were
      permanently deleted. I was able to recover the files using the command
      "git pull origin main". This pulled the recent commits back to my file
      explorer. I learned that upon completion of the commit process in github,
      we must go back to our main branch in vscode. At that point you complete
      the git pull command. I also learned a few more useful git commands, which
      I will list below.
      <ul>
        <li>git branch</li>
        <li>git branch -m old-name new-name</li>
        <li>git branch -d branchname</li>
        <li>git branch -D branchname</li>
        <li>git push origin --delete branchname</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branchname</li>
        <li>git branch branchname</li>
      </ul>
